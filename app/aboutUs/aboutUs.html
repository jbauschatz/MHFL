        <h3>What is HEMA?</h3>
        <p>
            HEMA is the acronym for Historic European Martial Arts, which encompasses the study and
            practice of martial arts developed within the European continent prior to the modern age.
            Our goal is simple: To be deadly efficient while using swords, pole-arms and bare hands. We
            take our lessons from manuscripts written by Masters dating back to 1300CE. HEMA learns from
            the Master's life experiences since living and dying by the sword and other Arts of War was
            their reality. The international HEMA community transcribes, interprets and then physically
            applies those written works. We drill, train and compete with other HEMA practitioners to
            recreate the true-to-form cold efficiency of these disciplines. HEMA is a growing movement
            with many facets of study available including armored fighting, two-handed or single-handed
            swords, pole-arms and wrestling. Though we ultimately use blunted steel weapons for
            realistic training, HEMA focuses on the safe and controlled application of proper technique.
            Historic European Martial Arts were a deadly practice, but we prefer not to injure our
            training partners and ensure that all participants use appropriate safety equipment for the
            activity.
